    <h4> WHY I LOVE PROGRAMMING </h4>
    <p class="p3">I have an immense love for coding and the reason is being able to code is like having a supernatural power,you can literally create anything from scratch. Itâ€™s crazy how few lines of code can make a machine do anything we want. If you want that the lights of your room should automatically be switched off as soon as you leave the room , if you want your mobile phone to automatically send emails and messages , even if you want to make a robot for yourself to do all the hard work , everything seems possible when you know how to <strong> programme.</strong> </p>
